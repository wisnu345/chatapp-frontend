### About This Project

This project is frontend for my last new project, chat application project, i used vue JS for built this frontend and some technologies includes vuex, vue router, axios etc. and i also added vue2-google-Maps for using Maps technologies, and the most complicated for this project i think while i set up the socket.io-client for realtime chat, there is very tricky and many complicated logic, at least this project is not finished yet, but i hope i can finish this project as soon as possible.
